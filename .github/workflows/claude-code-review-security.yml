            Please review this pull request focusing specifically on:
            - Security vulnerabilities (injection attacks, XSS, CSRF, authentication/authorization issues)
            - Sensitive data exposure (secrets, credentials, PII)
            - Performance issues (N+1 queries, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms)
            - Resource exhaustion risks (unbounded loops, missing timeouts)

            Be thorough but concise. Only report actual concerns, not hypotheticals.

            Everything but a brief summary goes in a <details> section.
